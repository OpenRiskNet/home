# OpenRiskNet

This is the central git repository for OpenRiskNet.

Go to the [OpenRiskNet Wiki](https://github.com/OpenRiskNet/home/wiki).

## Access to the repositories

We anticpate that most repositories will be open to all OpenRiskNet partners, but that there might occasionally be reasons to restrict access. To facilitate this we have a created a "developers" team to which people from all partners will be added, and, by default, that team will be associated with all new repositories. If we do need restricted access then additional teams will be created accordingly and used for specific repositories.

If you are not already a member of the "developers" team you should request access. Without membership of this team you will typically only have read-only access to repositories. Once you are added to that team you will get read-write access to most, if not all repositories.
