# Try to renew the certificates (typically using certbot's certonly option).
# To determine whether certificates have been renewed we need to check the
# stdout of the command. If certificates were not renewed you'll see something
# like this in the output stream...
#
#   Cert not yet due for renewal
#
# And, if successful, you should see something like: -
#
#   Congratulations!

# In order for this to work with the more recent certbot I believe we
# need to suspend the master's API service during the renewal...
