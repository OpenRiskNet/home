# Integrating Keycloak and Python Django on OpenShift
In this recipe we will set up Keycloak authentication for a Python Django project and run it in MiniShift.

## Getting a sample Django project to work on
OpenShift comes with a sample Django template and [repository](https://github.com/openshift/django-ex). 
We are going to need to edit the Django project so start by cloning it into your own Github account and 
check it out to your machine.
