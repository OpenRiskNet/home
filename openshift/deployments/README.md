# OpenShift deployments

This directory will contain examples of different types of OpenShift deployments.
The aim is to make it easy to deploy different scale deployments to different infrastructures
(e.g. different cloud providers).

We anticipate are the very least to support these types of deployments:

* simple one-server deployment for basic experimentation
* standard availability allowing moderate scaleability
* high availability providing a high levels of fault tolerance and scaleability

We anticipate at the very least to support these infrastructures:

* OpenStack - for flexible use and deployment to in-house clusters
* Amazon AWS - for robust cloud production deployments
* Scaleway - for low cost cloud deployments

Examples will be located in the sub-directories.
