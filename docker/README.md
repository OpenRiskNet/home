# Docker

## What is Docker
Docker is a tool designed to make it easier to create, deploy, and run
applications by using containers. Containers allow a developer to package up
an application with all of the parts it needs, such as libraries and other
dependencies, and ship it all out as one package. By doing so, thanks to the
container, the developer can rest assured that the application will run on any
other Linux machine regardless of any customised settings that machine might
have that could differ from the machine used for writing and testing the code.

>   Docker is only one open/commercialised form of Containers. Other
    technologies exists (like Rocket) but Docker seems to have taken the
    industry by storm. It is a large a fast-growing community and is the
    application execution and storage technology behind OpenShift.

## Getting started
